# RedditSentimentAnalysis
Reddit Sentiment Analysis Project

Update needed for code cleanliness, style, and clarity, but is currently functional.
Relevant code for webscraping, cleaning, training and testing is in webscraped_info.py.

In order to run it, one will need to go to reddit's website and request developers use of its API. After doing so, put your developer information within the relevant_data method. After doing so, you will be free to run the software!

Some further improvements I will be working on is code clean-up, webscraping and saving a practice dataset, and more complex sentiment analysis (angry, happy, sad).
